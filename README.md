# Experiment: clustering mammals with the Lempel Ziv Jaccard Distance

Requirements: In order to run the code, you'll need to be in a Linux environment with either Python2 or Python3 installed.

## Synopsis
Test the Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance (LZJD) metric to cluster mitochondrial proteins from 38 mammals.

## Repo Overview
This repo contains 12 concatenated mitochondrial proteins from 38 mammals in the `data` directory.  The proteins are represented as DNA sequences.  There are also four randomly generated DNA sequences as a sanity check.

The scripts to measure the pairwise LZJD between all the mammals is in the `src` directory.

To cluster the mammals' proteins, run the following command:
```
./src/measure_and_cluster.sh
```

You'll see the clustered mammals in:
```
./results/clusters.txt
```

If the LZJD metric works correctly, you should see an intuitive clustering of the mammals, and the random genomes clustered separately from the mammals.
