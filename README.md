# Clustering mammals with the Lempel Ziv Jaccard Distance

This repo contains 12 concatenated mitochondrial proteins from each of 34 mammals in the `data` directory.  The proteins are represented as DNA sequences.  There are also four randomly generated DNA sequences as a sanity check.

To cluster the mammals' proteins, run the following command:
```
python cluster.py data
```

If the LZJD metric works correctly, you should see an intuitive clustering of the mammals, and the random genomes clustered separately from the mammals.  Look in the `results.txt` file to see an example run.

LZJD is parameter free, so you can run this script on any directory of files, and see the results.  Just replace `data` in the previous command with the path to the directory.
